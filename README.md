# `gh-edit`

Edit Issues, PRs, Comments, and Gists locally

> It's like https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_gist_edit but better

Easy as:
```bash
gh edit https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123#issuecomment-456
```

If you spend a lot of time typing on GitHub and miss the comfort of your own
editor, I feel you.

This is why I wrote this little script, it syncs-on-save a local file with a
PR/Issue/Comment/Gist.

See more in [`./gh-edit`](./gh-edit) or with `gh edit -h`.
